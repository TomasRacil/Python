#DangQuyTai_Movie_Recommendation
TasteDive (formerly named TasteKid) is an entertainment recommendation engine for films, TV shows, music, video games, and books. It also has elements of a social media site. When a user types in the title of a film or TV show, the site's algorithm provides a list of similar content. The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users.

The project will use TasteDive to get related movies for the movies that the user enters. Then combine the resulting list of related movies and sort them by their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which would require making an API call to the OMDB API.)

To get the API Key of TasteDive and OMDb, you can log in to the homepage of the two websites above. Register an account and get a free Key, or you can also use the paid version to be able to use more service.

My project is inspired by the course "Foundations of Python Programming" in Cousera and the RESTful API part of that course.
